## Human readable duration format:
Find the Kata [here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52742f58faf5485cae000b9a).

Task:

 	Your task is to write a function which formats a duration, given as a number of seconds,
    in a human-friendly way.

## Is a number prime?:
Find the Kata [here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5262119038c0985a5b00029f).

Task:

 	Define a function that takes an integer argument and returns a logical value true or false
    depending on if the integer is a prime. Per Wikipedia, a prime number ( or a prime ) is a
    natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.


## Tortoise racing:
Find the Kata [here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52742f58faf5485cae000b9a).

Task:

 	Two tortoises named A and B must run a race. Given two speeds v1 (A's speed, integer > 0)
    and v2 (B's speed, integer > 0) and a lead g (integer > 0) how long will it take B to catch A?

## Human readable time:
Find the Kata [here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52685f7382004e774f0001f7).

Task:

 	Write a function, which takes a non-negative integer (seconds) as input and returns the time
    in a human-readable format (HH:MM:SS).

## Matrix addition:
Find the Kata [here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/526233aefd4764272800036f).

Task:

 	Write a function that accepts two square matrices (N x N two dimensional arrays),
    and return the sum of the two. Both matrices being passed into the function will
    be of size N x N (square), containing only integers.

## Rot13:
Find the Kata [here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/530e15517bc88ac656000716).

Task:

 	Create a function that takes a string and returns the string ciphered with Rot13.
    If there are numbers or special characters included in the string, they should be
    returned as they are. Only letters from the latin/english alphabet should be shifted,
    like in the original Rot13 "implementation".

## Matrix addition:
Find the Kata [here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/526233aefd4764272800036f).

Task:

 	Write a function that accepts two square matrices (N x N two dimensional arrays),
    and return the sum of the two. Both matrices being passed into the function will
    be of size N x N (square), containing only integers.
